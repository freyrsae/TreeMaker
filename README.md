# D3 graph stuff
##TreeMaker
A simple app for creating trees (the graph theory type).

An app that lets the user click on nodes to add neighbours to it and thus create trees. 
This is my first ever project using D3 and was mostly done to try it out.

##GraphUnveiling
A similar app that gradually unveils a predetermined graph (hardcoded into the js file) as you click the nodes.
